# --- odo CLI ---
# odo stores file-sync state here; never commit it
.odo/
pgdata/
# When odo adds its index files one-by-one, ignore them too
.odo/odo-file-index.json
.odo/env
.odo/push.yaml

# If you prefer to keep a dedicated .odoignore file instead
# make sure the .odo dir itself is listed there as well.
#
# Other patterns follow your stack; e.g. add:
#   node_modules/      for Node
#   target/            for Maven
#   __pycache__/ *.pyc for Python
